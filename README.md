# IMDB_dashboard_excel
This is a Dashboard which interactively displays and visualises the IMDB dataset.
Steps involved:
1. Data wrangling i.e., data preproccesing on this data set. Dataset is thoroughly cleaned by handling null values, removing duplicates, inconsistent data/datatype.
2. Read the data and created relevant pivot tables and charts.
3. Collected and aligned these charts into a single sheet and added filters and slicers to add interactivity to the dashboard.
